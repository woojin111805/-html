            Ivan Benjamin Elijah Toney (born 16 March 1996) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Brentford and the England national team.

            Toney became the youngest player to represent Northampton Town when he made his first-team debut in 2012. He scored 13 goals in 60 matches in all competitions before joining Newcastle United in 2015. In his first season at Newcastle, he had two successive loan spells with Barnsley, winning the 2015–16 Football League Trophy and the 2016 League One play-offs. He spent the next two years on loan in League One with Shrewsbury Town, Scunthorpe United, and Wigan Athletic.
            
            In 2018, Toney joined Peterborough United permanently for an undisclosed fee, where he was named both League One top scorer and Player of the Season in 2019–20. He then signed for Brentford, where his record-setting 31 goals scored during the 2020–21 season helped the club earn promotion to the Premier League. Toney received his first call-up for the England national team in 2022 before making his debut in 2023.
            
            In May 2023, after his 20 goals helped Brentford to a top-half finish, he was found guilty of 232 breaches of the Football Association's betting rules and banned from football for eight months, until 17 January 2024.
